# Personas

## About Personas
This web app was created as an independent final project for PROG450A - PROG450C @ Columbia College Chicago taught by Mike Hadley 

### Tech Stack
- react 
- firebase / firestore
- visual studio code 

## Goals
The overall goal of the web app is to make generating persona content easier. As a UX designer I spend a lot of time creating personas. I also found that some of the random data I struggled to think of each time. I wanted to create a tool I could use to generate the general infromation for a persona that is not necessarily project dependent. I found a few similar web apps but they all lacked the ability to dictate gender or age. I wanted to create a tool where the user can dictate either age, gender, both, or neither and get back useful data for their user personas.

## Current State
As the web app stands users can generate a random persona and save said persona. The implamentation of the drop down menus and photo components were not able to be realized within the scope of the class. The functionality was going to be that drop down menus will control the gender and age of the persona generated. Then the gender and age selections will then determine the photo that is generated. The  photo will come from a pool of photos that meet the specfications of the drop of the down and be randomized within that pool.

## Future iterations
Once the functionality of the drop downs and the photo components the next phase would be allowing users the ability to organize personas by project, so they are able to organize their content. This next phase would also include allowing users to download the persona as an image file. The last phase would be centered around allowing users to create an entire persona within the web app. This would include creating a template that had the traditional structure of a UX persona and allow the user to both input thier own content and generate random content within one persona. Then they would be able to save it to a project and/or download the whole image file. 

## Notes
The web app currently is not completly responsive. The goals of the class were focused on functionality of code not design. The web app is respionsive to 13in and 32in screens.
